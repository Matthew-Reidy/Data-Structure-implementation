Term project from data structers an algorithms class Fall 2018. 

During this class I and my 4 others team mates were clueless programmers having only had rougly a years expirience each with programming anything. It didn't help that I was elected as team lead.
As a result I was designing the program in an extremely naieve way. 
Now that I am a better programmer Im going to refactor this code base so that this project can be close to a profession level of quality.

ReWrite Goals
-Use Object Oriented Principles

-Clean readable code

-Highly Maintainable for future enhancements

-Refresh and practice java knowledge and programming
